# CS210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project three assignment basically had me creating a code that allowed a user to input what item, such as produce/dairy/pantry/ ect, into a device and show them the records of each item that was purchased.

What did you do particularly well?

  I think I structured the code well. I had my difficulties, but I understand how to start and end my code well even if there are a few hiccups in the middle.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I think that I could work on not making my code so simple, and using more complex and percise commands instead of simple and generic ones. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  I struggled quite a bit with this code, since I found trouble pulling data from the text file and letting the code run. I definitely need to work more on that to strengthen my skills. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Like the previous question, I used simple commands to make my code more readable; so that way when I do run into errors, it is easier for me to go back and fix the problems without having to read the code several times over to find what exactly I am looking for.
